# Medical Machine Learning Platform

## General Information
This repository contains the prototypical implementation of my Masterthesis in 2019 at the *University of Heidelberg* in the medical context of the *German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ)*: 

**Platform to Assist Medical Experts in Training, Application, and Control of Machine Learning Models Using Patient Data from a Clinical Information System** 

The full thesis and further information are published in the Heidelberg Document Repository: [HeiDOKs](http://www.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/archiv/27008).

Further changes and developments after July 2019 were performed independently from the Heidelberg University and the DKFZ.

## Platform Data Storage Structure
All data objects are stored using UUIDs to avoid conflicts with similar objects.

* */data* is per default created and mounted to stores the data of the platform.
* */data/MMLP/models* contains all data related to models, including training snapshots.
* */data/MMLP/datasets* contains all data sets uploaded by the user.
* */data/MMLP/results* if a user uploads data and applies a model, the resulting predictions are stored here.

The configuration is part of the backend, check backend/README and backend/mmlp/config.py

## System Requirements
This prototypical platform implementation does support on-premise, hybrid, and public clouds. 
It is tested on [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/), [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/), and [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com).
In case you need assistance, please contact me.

Before you attempt to deploy the platform, please ensure your system meets the following requirements:

1. [Docker](https://www.docker.com) is installed
2. GPU support is available within docker (if you run machine learning on GPU)
 For Nvidia GPUS: https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker
 For AMD GPUs: https://rocm.github.io/
3. If you do not update the default configuration, the following settings are assumed:
 The global folder */data* is used to store all kinds of data related to the platform; it could consume a lot of disk space, depending on your model and data set.
 If you use a distributed computing environment, please ensure this folder is appropriately shared between the computing nodes.
 *Note*: Currently, distribution and scaling are planned but not yet implemented. Please contact me for further information.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/magreiner/MMLP
cd MMLP
```

2. Adjust the configuration
```bash
vi backend/mmlp/Config.py
```

3. Deploy the platform
The platform can be deployed using docker-compose:
```bash
# build the containers (repeat this step every time you changed the code or the configuration)
docker-compose build --parallel

# foreground deployment (useful for development, showing the logs directly):
docker-compose up

# background deployment as service (access logs via docker-compose -f logs)
docker-compose up -d
```

4. Enjoy
 If deployed locally you can access the platform on port 80 with http://localhost 
 *Note:* 
 * https is not activated by default, due to the increased complexity with the certificates. To create certificates [Letsencrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) is recommended.
 * Sometimes, the browser tries to switch to https automatically and fails. If the platform is not showing as expected, check your browser.
